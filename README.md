# Harms_Insurance_Website

I originally built a website for this insurance company via Wordpress but decided to re-create it from scratch
to improve my coding skills.

The home page uses the Unslider jQuery plugin to scroll through the slides.

The website makes use of the Boostrap grid and responsive menu, but all other css is written from scratch.
The site is responsive and looks great on mobile devices.

I used SASS to organize the pages into partials, with each page being it's own SASS file. There are separate files for 
base styles, variables, and typography.

The contact page uses the Google Maps API to retrieve the map and the company's location.
The contact form is validated with jQuery and a thank you message appears when the form 
is submitted correctly.
